I made a big order in 2011 and have been pretty happy with the results. I really like that you can filter their hosta selection by slug and sun resistance. They have other great shade plants too, along with a few sun selections.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.savageplants.com\">Savage Plants &amp; Landscape</a><br />\nI love this nursery! It&#8217;s not far from our house as the crow flies but unfortunately there&#8217;s a ferry ride involved. If that weren&#8217;t the case this would be my go-to plant source. Savage is a bit smaller than the mainland nurseries I frequent which makes for a less daunting browsing session. And they make up for their smaller size by having a better selection of unusual plants. We&#8217;ve picked up some great hard-to-find shade plants on our way back from trips to Bainbridge or the Olympic Peninsula. If it&#8217;s open when we pass by, it&#8217;s pretty much a given that we will stop and have a look around.</p>\n",

Not bad, although the ivy climbing up the tree in the vacant lot behind us kinda bugs.</p></div>\n<h2>Welcome to My Shade Garden</h2>\n<h3>Have you ever become suddenly, weirdly obsessed with something that you&#8217;ve never previously given a second thought to?</h3>\n<p>That happened to me in 2006 when my husband John and I bought an old house on a big, treed lot in a shady suburb north of Seattle. I got bit by the gardening bug as it were. And in the first year, I quickly discovered that any plant requiring full sun was doomed in our garden. Which is kinda ok – I&#8217;ve found my niche, right?</p>\n<h5><strong>What this website is – and isn&#8217;t.</strong></h5>\n<p>This site is dedicated to shade gardening (with a splash of indoor plants). I love gardening, but I&#8217;m not an expert. I&#8217;m learning over time and am slowly becoming a someone who knows a thing or two. I also have little patience for fussy plants that need lots of attention. Our yard is nearly a half acre and there just isn&#8217;t time for that! Our gardens are in progress, imperfect, very Darwinian environments – so plants that do well in our yard will probably do well in yours.</p>\n<h5>There are a lot of gardening websites. Why make another one?</h5>\n<p>Although you can find information about shade gardening on many sites, there seem to be few (or none) dedicated to it. So here I am, I&#8217;m putting my virtual stake in the ground. I figured if some of the information I&#8217;ve collected over the years could help other folks with the shady bits of their gardens, why not put it out there?</p>\n<h5>Why now?</h5>\n<p>For the last decade, I&#8217;ve dutifully collected nursery tags in an ugly white big binder that&#8217;s now bursting at the seams. So last year, in lieu of binder proliferation, I decided to build this website. And I figured because it&#8217;s a website, why not add a navel-gazey blog? Maybe include some details about our property and its microclimates? Most importantly, this will hopefully replace that old-school binder with clean, expandable repository of data that is sortable and searchable.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1150\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164.jpg\" data-rel=\"lightbox-1\" title=\"\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1150\" data-permalink=\"http://atreegarden.com/about/book/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164.jpg?fit=919%2C1024\" data-orig-size=\"919,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D90&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1492691394&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;44&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"My Gardening Binder\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164.jpg?fit=269%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164.jpg?fit=750%2C836\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164-269x300.jpg?resize=269%2C300\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164.jpg?resize=269%2C300 269w, https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164.jpg?resize=768%2C855 768w, https://i1.wp.com/atreegarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/book-e1492716128164.jpg?w=919 919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This binder has served me well but I think it&#8217;s time to upgrade.</p></div>\n<p>Lastly, this is also a surreptitious web development project.
